// Learning Processing Lesson One Project
// 1) Design a static screen drawing using RGB color and primitive shapes.
// 2) Make the static screen drawing dynamic by having it interact with the mouse.
//    This might include shapes following the mouse, changing their size according
//    to the mouse, changing their color according to the mouse, and so on.

// Ten lines.
